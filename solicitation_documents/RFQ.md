# 1.0 Background

This document represents a Performance Work Statement to acquire
services for the Office of Products and Platforms (OPP), Data.gov
Program Management Office. Data.gov is looking for a contractor that can
provide technical application development support.

Data.gov is the home of the U.S. Government’s open data. Users can find
Federal, state and local data, tools, and resources to conduct research,
build applications, design data visualizations, and more. The main
components of Data.gov are:

  - [<span class="underline">Data.gov</span>](https://www.data.gov/): the program’s homepage.

  - [<span class="underline">Catalog.Data.gov</span>](https://catalog.data.gov/): a [<span class="underline">CKAN</span>](http://ckan.org/) instance that harvests data inventories maintained by agencies in multiple formats (including DCAT data.json, FGDC CSDGM and ISO 19115 via WAF and CSW, and other CKAN APIs) and is updated on a daily basis.

  - [<span class="underline">Inventory.data.gov</span>](https://inventory.data.gov/): a separate CKAN instance used by several federal agencies to manage and update their metadata (i.e. data.json files) which are then downloaded and hosted on the websites of those agencies.

  - [<span class="underline">Project Open Data Dashboard</span>](https://labs.data.gov/dashboard): a PHP web application for doing automated metadata analysis and measuring open data progress and by agencies per Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive M-13-13.

  - Data.gov help desk: a PHP Web Application that serves as a lightweight customer relationship management tool to manage dataset problems and requests.

  - [<span class="underline">Federation.data.gov</span>](https://federation.data.gov/) and [<span class="underline">sdg.data.gov</span>](https://sdg.data.gov/): Jekyll-based static websites that support the Data.gov mission.

Data.gov’s primary goal for this procurement is to expand on the current
implementation of CKAN in the Data.gov program by creating a
government-wide CKAN platform that supports individual agency CKAN
instances with the option of agency-specific branding. The
government-wide platform will offer capabilities such as metadata
management support, file hosting, and application programming interfaces
(APIs) based on the features available through CKAN.

# 2.0 Requirements

To continue to successfully achieve Data.gov’s mission, Data.gov
requires the support of a qualified contractor. The Contractor is
required to provide a team of CKAN developers to develop and maintain
Data.gov’s CKAN-based applications.

## 2.1 Tasks

### Base Period:

The contractor shall complete the following tasks:

1.  Design and develop a platform that supports multi-tenant CKAN
    instances for use by multiple federal agencies. This platform
    shall have the following features:

    1.  CKAN version 2.8 (or higher)

    2.  White-label branding and custom domain name support

    3.  Capable of publishing metadata following the Project Open Data
        [<span class="underline">schema</span>](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/)
        (e.g. using the
        [<span class="underline">ckanext-datajson</span>](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datajson)
        and
        [<span class="underline">USMetadata</span>](https://github.com/GSA/USMetadata/)
        extensions)

    4.  Dataset hosting based on CKAN DataStore

    5.  Automatic generation of APIs for datasets based on CKAN
        DataStore

    6.  Capable of deployment on the Data.gov PMO’s existing Amazon
        Web Service infrastructure

2.  Coordinate with the Data.gov PMO on management of code releases,
    general system architecture, security requirements, and
    deployment, and work in the open and in alignment with existing
    Data.gov repositories on GitHub. While the contractor shall not be
    responsible for receiving authority to operate from GSA IT, the
    contractor shall design and develop the application to receive
    such authority without changes to the source code.

3.  Support the Data.gov PMO to onboard participating agencies in the
    initial version of the platform. The contractor will deliver
    deployable code and demonstrate functionality by deploying on a
    staging environment that is identical to the production
    environment.

4.  As necessary, contribute to open-source repositories maintained by
    the Data.gov PMO.

### Option Periods:

The contractor shall complete the following tasks during each Option
Period:

1.  Support the Data.gov PMO to onboard additional participating
    agencies to the platform for multi-tenant CKAN instances.

    the platform for the multi-tenant CKAN instances developed.

3.  Provide operations and maintenance of the platform for
    multi-tenant CKAN instances developed via the base and option
    periods.

### Optional Tasks:

Each of the following tasks may or may not be awarded via a modification
pending availability of funds at anytime during the life of the Task
Order. The Contractor shall not perform work on any of these tasks until
they have been added via modification and are given a notice to proceed
from the CO. If the Contractor performs any of the work prior to a
modification, they do so at their own risk. The Contractor shall provide
prices for all tasks, including optional tasks, at a part of their
quotation. The Contractor will be asked to hold the quoted prices.

**Optional Task 1:** Develop a transition plan to move the current
version of the Data.gov catalog to the platform for multi-tenant CKAN
instances developed under the required tasks, including a migration
guide of steps necessary to provide required functionality of the
Data.gov catalog harvester to harvest data.json sources following
[<span class="underline">Project Open
Data</span>](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) as well as
[<span class="underline">geospatial</span>](https://digital.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/#federal-geospatial-data)
metadata sources.

**Optional Task 2:** Implement the transition of the Data.gov catalog to
the platform for multi-tenant CKAN instances developed during the base
period, including provision of required functionality of the Data.gov
catalog harvester to harvest data.json sources following
[<span class="underline">Project Open
Data</span>](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) as well as
[<span class="underline">geospatial</span>](https://digital.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/#federal-geospatial-data)
metadata sources.

and conformance with the Task Order requirements by the Government.
Inspection may include validation of information or software through the
use of automated tools and/or testing of the deliverables, as specified
in the [<span class="underline">Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
(QASP)</span>](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-ckan-multitenant/blob/master/solicitation_documents/QASP.md).

The Government requires a period not to exceed 30 days after receipt of
final deliverable items for inspection and acceptance or rejection.

### 2.2.3 Basis of Acceptance

Data.gov develops, tests, approves or rejects, and releases approved new
code to production in an incremental manner. The GSA TTS Product Owner,
COR and the Contractor will agree on a protocol for testing in
accordance with the
[<span class="underline">QASP</span>](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-ckan-multitenant/blob/master/solicitation_documents/QASP.md).
All of the Government’s comments to deliverables must either be
incorporated in the succeeding version or the Contractor shall
demonstrate to the Government’s satisfaction why such comments should
not be incorporated.

### 3.7.2 Key Personnel

The Government considers Key Personnel to include the Contractor team
members (e.g. firm employees, independent contractors, subcontractor
employees, etc.) necessary to demonstrate the Contractor’s technical
capability to deliver the requirements of this Task Order. Designation
as Key Personnel is not tied to any specific labor category or level,
and is at the sole discretion of the Contractor.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall identify one member of the Key
Personnel that:

  - Has a full understanding of the technical approach discussed in
    the Oral Interviews and delivered by the Contractor after award;

  - Will be a direct liaison to the CO, COR, and the GSA TTS Product
    Owner. In this capacity, this individual shall be responsible for
    the supervision of the Contractor’s personnel, technical
    assistance, and interface.

### 3.7.3 Key Personnel Changes

If any individual proposed as Key Personnel becomes unavailable during
the period of performance, the Contractor shall notify the CO
immediately. Any Key Personnel proposed who are not currently employed
by the Contractor shall be identified as such and an additional letter
of intent signed by the proposed Key Personnel shall be provided that
indicates that person's intent to be employed by the Contractor if
awarded this Task Order.

In the event the Contractor deems it necessary to make any changes to
the Staffing Plan (including removing, adding, or substituting Key
Personnel assigned to the project), the Contractor shall promptly notify
the CO, COR, and the GSA TTS Product Owner and provide, at a minimum,
the following information for Government approval:

  - A detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the
    change in personnel;

  - A resume for all employees being removed from and added to the
    project team;

  - A revised copy of the Staffing Plan;

As determined by the CO, all proposed substitutes/additions must have
qualifications that meet or exceed the qualifications of the person to
be replaced or supplemented.  

The CO, with input from the COR and the GSA TTS Product Owner, will
evaluate all the proposed changes in Key Personnel and the CO will
notify the Contractor, in writing, of approval or disapproval.
Disapproval of the proposed changes shall not provide grounds for
non-performance by the Contractor or form the basis of any claim for
monies, delivery schedule extension, or any other equitable adjustment.

### 3.7.4 Employee Identification

When on-site, Contractor employees shall comply with all Government
escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify
themselves as contractors when their status is not readily apparent and
display all identification and visitor badges in plain view at all
appropriate times while on-site.

### 3.7.5 Employee Conduct

The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to
remove any Contractor employee from government facilities for any
unprofessional behavior, general misconduct, or breaches of security, as
deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer (CO) or Contracting
Officer’s Representative (COR). Removal does not relieve the Contractor
of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under
this Task Order. Furthermore, the Contractor shall promptly replace the
removed employee with an equally or better qualified employee within the
same labor category within 5 business days.

# 4.0 Task Order Administration

## 4.1 Post Award Orientation Conference

The government's team, including the CO, COR, and the TTS Product Owner,
will hold a kickoff meeting/post-award conference with the Contractor
within 10 calendar days of the Task Order award. This kickoff will
include the Contractor’s team and other relevant Government staff to
review and clarify the project’s objectives, expectations or the
Government, and address any questions the Contractor may have.

## 4.2 Travel

Travel to attend in-person meetings held in the Washington,
DC-Metropolitan Area may be required. All travel will be in accordance
with the [<span class="underline">Federal Travel
Regulations</span>](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr).

The Contractor shall obtain written approval from the CO, COR, and GSA
TTS Product Owner at least one week prior to traveling. The Government
is not obligated to pay for travel taken by the Contractor without
proper authorization. The Contractor shall submit an email to the CO,
COR, and GSA TTS Product Owner and include the following information:

  - Traveler(s) Name(s);

  - Purpose of travel;

  - Task Order Number;

  - Destination(s), origin, departure date, return date, and number of
    days for each traveler; and

  - Travel estimates, including airfare, lodging, rental car, per
    diem, mileage, and any reimbursable items (metro, parking, etc.)

Travel will be billed separately and at a reimbursable, Not-To-Exceed
(NTE) amount. If additional funds are required, the Contractor must seek
modification for increase prior to approval. If the NTE is exceeded
without modification and/or approval, the Government reserves the right
to reject invoices for travel in excess of the established NTE amount.

## 4.3 Quality Assurance

The Government will use the attached draft
[<span class="underline">QASP</span>](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-ckan-multitenant/blob/master/solicitation_documents/QASP.md)
to monitor the Contractor’s performance. The scope and nature of this
testing included in the QASP is intended to be sufficiently
comprehensive to ensure the completeness, quality and adequacy of all
deliverables. The QASP will provide oversight help to ensure that
service levels reach and maintain the required levels for performance of
this Task Order. Further, the QASP provides the Government with a
proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and
provides verifiable input for the required
[<span class="underline">Contractor Performance Assessment Report
(CPARs)</span>](https://www.cpars.gov/). The QASP is a living document
and may be updated by the Government as necessary. Any updates to the
QASP will be provided to the Contractor at the time of the update.

## 4.4 Contractor Performance

Performance will be documented in
[<span class="underline">CPARs</span>](https://www.cpars.gov/) at the
end of each performance period (include the base and option periods).
Interim reports may also be used. Should deficiencies in performance
occur, the Contractor may be notified by the CO/COR in oral or written
format. The Government may require the Contractor to re-perform any
services that do not conform to order requirements.

## 4.5 Invoicing

The Contractor must submit invoices on a monthly basis and a final
invoice at the end of the period of performance within 60 calendar days
from contract completion. No further charges are to be billed following
the final invoice submission. A completed and signed Release of Claims
(GSA Form 1142) shall be provided to the CO with the submission of a
final invoice.

### 4.5.1 Content of Invoice

The Contractor will be provided with the following information when the
Task Order has been awarded:

  - Contract/Task Order Number

  - CLIN number and title

  - The Accounting Number associated with the task order

All of this information, along with the Period of Performance covered by
the invoice, must be included on each invoice in addition to the
requirements for a proper invoice specified in FAR 52.212-4 (g) and the
Prompt Payment clause, FAR 52.212-4(i)(2).

### 4.5.2 Invoice Submission

The Contractor is required to submit invoices to GSA Vendor Customer

# 5.0 Terms and Conditions

## 5.1 TTS Transparency Policy

Vendors are advised that TTS reserves the right to publish documents
associated with this acquisition on a publicly-available website,
including any Requests for Quotation or their amendments, as well as
question and answer exchanges with vendors (source-identifying
information removed). TTS reserves the right to publish any other
relevant information that is not confidential or proprietary in nature,
but will not publish any source-selection sensitive information that
would otherwise implicate procurement integrity concerns.

Upon award of the Task Order, TTS may publish the total awarded price
and certain non-source-identifying data (e.g. number of bids, mean
price, median price, and standard deviation of price). During the
performance of this task order, TTS may similarly publish data related
to project management (e.g. user stories, milestones, and performance
metrics) and top-line spending data.

## 5.2 Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables

The Government shall have unlimited rights in any data first created in
the performance of this Task Order in accordance with FAR 52.227-14,
Alternates II and III. For the avoidance of doubt, all deliverables and
any item listed below are “data” within the meaning of the FAR clauses.

TTS intends that any data or deliverable created as a result of the work
performed under this Task Order be committed to the public domain.

Further, TTS intends to commit the following items, to the public
domain, at a minimum:

  - All data, documents, graphics and code created under this task
    order including but not limited to, plans, reports, schedules,
    schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the like;

    forks or branches of current open source software where the
    Contractor has made a modification; and,

  - Any and all new tooling, scripting configuration management,
    infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits to
    successfully deploy or operate the software.

The Contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in
support of the [<span class="underline">18F Source Code
Policy</span>](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/). All licenses
must be expressly listed in the deliverable. Regardless of license(s)
used (e.g., MIT, GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be
clearly listed in the documentation.

If the Contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source
license, the Contractor is required to request permission from TTS, in
writing, before utilizing that work in any way in connection with the
order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a
conspicuous place when work is delivered to TTS.

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the
Contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation
guidance is not available, the Contractor shall attach or include the
license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments
at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a
software repository.

## 5.3 Confidentiality and Nondisclosure

The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers
and other material deemed relevant by the agency that have been
generated by the Contractor in the performance of this project, are the
property of the U.S. Government and must be submitted to the GSA TTS

documentation shall be given to the agency during and at the end of this
contract. The Contractor shall not release any information without the
written consent of the GSA TTS Product Owner.

protected. When no longer required, this information, data, and/or
equipment shall be returned to Government control; destroyed; or held
until otherwise directed. Destruction of items shall be accomplished by
tearing into small parts; burning; shredding or any other method that

the Department of Defense method of a three time overwrite of the
sensitive data.

information used, gathered, disclosed, or developed as a result of work
under this contract. The Contractor shall also protect all Government
data by treating information as sensitive. All information gathered or
created under this contract shall be considered as Sensitive but
Unclassified (SBU) information. If Contractor personnel must remove any
information from the primary work area they should protect it to the
same extent they would their proprietary data and/or company trade
secrets. The use of this data is subject to the Privacy Act and shall be
utilized in full accordance with all rules of conduct as applicable to
Privacy Act Information.

# 8.0 Evaluation

## 8.1 Evaluation Criteria and Basis of Award

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart
[<span class="underline">8.4</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%208_4.html#wp1089480),
Federal Supply Schedules. FAR Part
[<span class="underline">15</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_1.html#wp1095839),
Contracting by Negotiation, procurement procedures are not being
utilized, except procedures within FAR Part
[<span class="underline">15.4</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208365),
Contract Pricing may be utilized, as allowed, for price analysis. All
submissions in response to this solicitation are considered quotations
and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The Quoters agree
to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this
solicitation. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive
range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, or use
other techniques associated with FAR part
[<span class="underline">15</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_1.html#wp1095839).

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value
principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be
made to the responsible quote that provides the greatest overall value
to the Government, price and other factors considered. In addition to
Price, the following technical factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

1)  Technical Approach

2)  Staffing Plan

3)  Similar Experience

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and
management capabilities than with making an award at the lowest overall
price to the Government. Quoters are advised that the technical
evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

## 8.2 Evaluation Process

The Government intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement
as described below. To be considered for award, each Quoter’s quote must
successfully pass through each phase.

Phase 1: Technical Evaluation - The Government will evaluate the
Quoter’s Technical Submittal, as provided in the
[<span class="underline">RFQ Response Form - GSA TTS Data.gov
Multi-Tenant CKAN Development
Support</span>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gr9gHzRJZ2LH6UrRzT4g40npWRi-I3ZYsLi5fv_h5RE/edit).
Quotes found to be technically acceptable by the Technical Evaluation
team will move on to oral interviews.

Phase 2: The Oral Interview will be focused on the Quoter’s technical
approach, staffing plan, and similar experience, as well as their
overall understanding of the requirements to perform the work outlined
in the solicitation. The oral interview is an opportunity for the
Government to ask the vendor questions -- the Government does not want
vendor presentations during this interview.

Phase 3: Pricing Submittal - Quoters’ Prices, as provided in the
[<span class="underline">RFQ Pricing Form - Data.gov Multi-Tenant CKAN
Development
Support</span>](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-ckan-multitenant/blob/master/solicitation_documents/RFQ%20Pricing%20Form.xlsx),
will be reviewed separately from the technical evaluation and will only
include Quoters who participate in the oral interview.

## 8.3 Evaluation Factors

### Factor 1: Technical Approach

The Government will evaluate each Quoter’s relative understanding of the
objectives and requirements of this solicitation, including depth of
understanding of specific CKAN versions, plug-ins and extensions,
clarity and detail of the technical approach and architecture for
achieving the multi-tenant platform, and depth of knowledge around
federated metadata management and common metadata standards including
DCAT and ISO 19115 as used by Data.gov.

The government will utilize this information to evaluate:

  - How the Quoter will accomplish the objectives and requirements of
    the Contract contemplated by this solicitation;

  - The relative feasibility and/or effectiveness of the proposed
    approach; and

  - The compatibility of the proposed approach to our organization.

### Factor 2: Staffing Plan

The Government will evaluate each Quoter’s relative ability to meet the
objectives and requirements of this solicitation, including:

  - The Quoter's ability to recruit and retain qualified staff;

  - The Quoter's ability to appropriately and adequately allocate
    capable/qualified staff to the Contract contemplated by this
    solicitation;

  - The Quoter's relative understanding of the level of effort and
    labor mix appropriate to accomplish the objectives and
    requirements of the Contract contemplated by this solicitation;
    and

  - Regarding Key Personnel: The extent and variety of experience in
    the technical areas listed in [<span class="underline">Section
    3.7.1 Required Knowledge</span>](#required-knowledge) and
    [<span class="underline">Section 7.2 Quotes</span>](#quotes) of
    this solicitation.

### Factor 3: Similar Experience

Similar Experience, as defined in [<span class="underline">Section 7.2
Quotes</span>](#quotes) of this solicitation, will be evaluated as an
indicator of each Quoters’ capacity to perform the Contract contemplated
by this solicitation.

Similar Experience will be evaluated on the basis of information
provided by each Quoter indicating completion of similar work as
described in [<span class="underline">Section 7.2
Quotes</span>](#quotes) of this solicitation.

### Factor 4: Price

The price quote for each Quoter invited to participate in Oral
Interviews will be evaluated separately from their technical quotation
and oral interview in order to ensure that the quoted price is fair,
reasonable, and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness,
consistency with industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and
terms and conditions in the GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-51 contract. As
submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated
price will become more important. Therefore, Quoters are encouraged to
provide their best discounted rates up front.

Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using
the prices quoted for the last option period to determine the price for
a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other
option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will
not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

## 8.4 Oral Interview Process

The Government is much more interested in the informational content of
the Quoter’s answers than the particular style or technique used in
delivering the answers. The Government may take notes during the
interview at its discretion, and may use such notes in the evaluation.
No copies will be provided to any Quoters.

####   
Oral Interview Rules

The oral interview, consisting of an initial question and answer session
on technical factors and a follow-up question and answer session (if
necessary), does not and will not constitute discussions or
negotiations. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive
range, conduct discussions, and solicit or allow revised quotes.
However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if
necessary. Quotation revisions will not be requested or accepted during
oral interviews.

The oral interview sessions will be conducted by video. The Government
will coordinate and set up the conferencing tool accordingly (providing
dial in or links to the tool). Quoters shall not bring or present
slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials nor
will the Government accept or receive Quoters handouts.

The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral interviews
with each Quoter, in random order, after the solicitation closing date
and receipt of quote submissions. The Government reserves the right to
reschedule any Quoter’s oral interview date at the discretion of the CO.

The Quoter may include as many participants as it feels is necessary and
is the sole responsibility of the Quoter. Quoters are advised to have
technical personnel present since the Government will ask technical
questions during the oral interviews. All proposed Key Personnel
currently employed by the Quoter or its teaming partners shall attend
the session - the Government is most interested in hearing from staff
that will have a direct role in performing on the Task Order. The
letter(s) of intent and resume(s) will suffice for Key Personnel
currently not employed by the Quoter, its teaming partners, or its
subcontractors.

After the interviews, Quoters shall provide the names of all
participates to the CO via email.

Quoter oral interviews will consist of the Quoter answering the
Government’s questions related to the technical factors identified in
this solicitation and the Quoters technical understanding and approach
of the requirements identified in this solicitation. The Government’s
questions may differ among the Quoters based on the portions of Quoter’s
proposal that need elaboration.

If necessary, the Government will ask follow-up questions regarding the
Quoter’s answers to the questions on technical factors. During this
time, the Government may ask questions on any information presented by
the Quoter that the Government feels is unclear or needs elaboration.
The Government’s questions may differ among the Quoters based on what
needs elaboration. If the Government has no follow-up questions with a
particular Quoter, then this part of the session will not take place.
The answers given in this session are part of the Quoter’s oral
interview.
