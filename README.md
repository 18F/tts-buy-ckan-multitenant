## Background

Data.gov is the home of the U.S. Government’s open data. Users can find Federal, state and local data, tools, and resources to conduct research, build applications, design data visualizations, and more.

Data.gov’s primary goal for this procurement is to expand on the current implementation of CKAN in the Data.gov program by creating a government-wide CKAN platform that supports individual agency CKAN instances with the option of agency-specific branding. The government-wide platform will offer capabilities such as metadata management support, file hosting, and application programming interfaces (APIs) based on the features available through CKAN.

### What we're hoping to end up with

Additional information is provided in [Requirements section](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-ckan-multitenant/blob/master/solicitation_documents/RFQ.md#requirements) of the RFQ, but in short, the vendor must:

- Design and develop a platform that supports multi-tenant CKAN instances for use by multiple federal agencies.
- Coordinate with the Data.gov PMO on management of code releases, general system architecture, security requirements, and deployment, and work in the open and in alignment with existing Data.gov repositories on GitHub.
- Support the Data.gov PMO to onboard participating agencies in the initial version of the platform.
- As necessary, contribute to open-source repositories maintained by the Data.gov PMO.

Additionally, there are several optional tasks, under which the vendor must:

- Develop a transition plan to move the current version of the Data.gov catalog to the platform for multi-tenant CKAN instances.
- Implement the transition of the Data.gov catalog to the platform for multi-tenant CKAN instances.
- Provide operations and maintenance support to Data.gov following the transition to the platform for multi-tenant CKAN instances.
